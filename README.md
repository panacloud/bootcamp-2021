# Bootcamp 2021: Learn to Build AI and AIoT Serverless Multi-Tenant SaaS APIs in Baby Steps and Build Your SaaS Startup

Covid-19 propelled businesses into the future, ready or not. “Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at Shopify Inc. “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.” We at Panacloud are trying to respond to these challenges and trying to lead from the front.

Panacloud Bootcamp 2021 will fuse AI, IoT, and AWS Serverless Cloud Technologies. The Bootcamp will use Python and Rust as its development languages, TensorFlow as ML framework, AWS as its Serverless Cloud platform, AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code.

## Must Have: Create Free AWS Account

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

## Part 1: Serverless using CDK

We will be writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) CDK AWS Serverless constructs in Python and Lambda Functions etc. in both Python and Rust
