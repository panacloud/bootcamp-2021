# Bootcamp 2021: Become a Certified Unicorn Developer (CUD) and Get Ready for the API Token Economy 

## Fusing Serverless, Graph, AI, IoT, DeFi, Blockchain, and Quantum Technologies

Covid-19 propelled businesses into the future, ready or not. “Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at Shopify Inc. “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.” We at Panacloud are trying to respond to these challenges and trying to lead from the front. For this purpose are starting a not-for-profit movement called Operation Unicorn. 

Operation Unicorn, is planning to introduce a Certified Unicorn Developer international certification. For developers, the word “unicorn” refers to someone with such a diverse range of skills that they’re incredibly rare. We believe that this rare breed will be required to develop Apps, Dapps, and APIs for the next generation of Unicorn Startups. The future developers will develop applications and APIs that will fuse Serverless/Cloud, Graph, AI, IoT, Blockchain, and Quantum Technologies.

[Report: 67% of developers embrace an API-first philosophy](https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/28/report-67-of-developers-embrace-an-api-first-philosophy/)

The certification program will be an eighteen-month program consisting of six quarters. The first four quarters will cover the foundations which will be required for creating Unicorn Startups:

Quarter 1: Introduction to API Token Economy and Fundamentals of Programming

Quarter 2: API Development using Serverless Cloud Computing

Quarter 3: Introduction to Token Economy, Smart Contracts and Dapps

Quarter 4: Introduction to AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the Cloud

For the last two-quarters students will choose from the following areas of specialization:

1. AI Cloud Specialist
2. IoT Cloud Specialist
3. DeFi and Dapps Specialist
4. Web and Hybrid Mobile App Specialist
5. Algorithms, Data Structures and Design Patterns Specialist
6. Quantum Computing Specialist

In Bootcamp 2021 we will finalize the curriculum for this certification program iteratively. Once the program is finalized and the pandemic is bit under-control, we will help you to open a training institute anywhere in the world which will train Unicorn Developers.

This is a Open and Free Bootcamp, for admission just [fill this admission form](https://forms.gle/QFvfSMquJZftyyiT9).

### Bootcamp 2021 Coverage

Panacloud Bootcamp 2021 will fuse AI, IoT, Blockchain, and AWS Serverless Cloud Technologies. The Bootcamp will use Python, TypeScript and Rust as its development languages, TensorFlow as ML framework, AWS as its Serverless Cloud platform, AWS Graph Database Neptune, Ethereum as Blockchain platform and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with TypeScript for Infrastructure as Code.

### Those interested in web and mobile Serverless SaaS apps and APIs should also focus on [Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/)

Difference Between Bootcamp 2020 and Bootcamp 2021

The objective of Bootcamp 2020 is to train developers to develop cloud based SaaS Apps and general serverless APIs for these apps. It includes developing graphic user interfaces (GUIs) development using React, Gatsby, and React Native.

[Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/)

The objective of Bootcamp 2021 is to train developers to develop cloud based AI, IoT, Blockchain, and Quantum powered serverless APIs. We will not cover graphic user interfaces (GUIs) in Bootcamp 2021 but only voice based conversational interfaces. A conversational interface (CUI) is a user interface for computers that emulates a conversation with a real human. The course of this bootcamp is designed in such a way that Bootcamp 2020 is not a prerequisite to Bootcamp 2021.

[Bootcamp 2021](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2021/)

The recording of Bootcamp 2020 is now complete and in a few months recording of Bootcamp 2021 will start. When we say recording of Bootcamp 2020 is complete, it does not mean that the Bootcamp 2020 is closed. Admissions and project acceptance will remain open in both the Bootcamps at atleast till December 2023. We are also developing a platform for developers which will adopt both these bootcamps. Our upcoming Operation Unicorn Startups will also require participations in these bootcamps.

[Cloud’s trillion-dollar prize is up for grabs](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/clouds-trillion-dollar-prize-is-up-for-grabs)

## Must Have: Create Free AWS Account

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

Now you can create virtual VISA Debit card through [NayaPay App](https://www.nayapay.com/) which can be used to create AWS/GCP/Azure account. This is good NEWS For those students who find it difficult to create physical VISA/Master Card from Banks; this is a great option to avail.

## Part 1: The API and Token Economy

### Class 1: Understanding the API Economy

The objective of Bootcamp 2021 is to prepare sofware developers for the API Economy (Application Programming Interface Economy). APIs are software interfaces that allow once separate software systems to seamlessly and easily talk to each other.  The innovative power of APIs has lead to the realization that software as a service (SaaS) applications can be built by combining APIs built by specialized API providers. That, in turn, has created the API Economy, which empowers developers to specialize and monetize their skills and domain knowledge.

A taxi booking SaaS app, for example, might combine a mapping SaaS API, communication SaaS API, and billing SaaS API, each from different providers, with their own UX layered on top. This makes it easy to launch new services without having to build everything from scratch. This makes it easier for all participants to develop unique products, services and functionality quickly and with less cost. 

In the API economy a developer may have different roles. It may be a SaaS developer or API provider. A API provider can also develop on top of other specialized APIs, thus creating layers of APIs. This creates an API economy where developers charge each other for the APIs built by them. The API provider charges others for using his APIs, and at the same time pays other providers to use their APIs. The SaaS app developers who uses all these APIs bills the end-customer for the service. This exchange of value is what makes an API economy.    

Ideally, the developer who uses SaaS APIs wants to be charged a usage based subscription fee, not a fixed monthly subscription. This usage based subscription fee has been made possible by serverless cloud technologies. Serverless is also being called Cloud 2.0.

The rise of of API Economy has created a new kind of software company i.e. an API-First Company. A company, which develops software not for the end-users as its main customer, but other developers who uses it as a component to build applications. The Panacloud platform provides the means by which developers and entrepreneurs can build their API-First Unicorn startups. 

The API Economy levels the playing field for everyone from the smallest developers to the largest companies. However, it also creates many challenges. First, often there is no direct contact between the API provider and the developer who utilizes it, it can be hard to know which API to build with what functionality. Second, it is difficult to know which APIs are available and which API to use and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. Third, most of the current SaaS applications and API are built using legacy Cloud 1.0 technologies, thus they don’t have usage based billing support and also some have scalability issues. Fourth, the APIs are centrally managed and multi-tenant by their very nature, making it difficult to manage, measure resource usage in a serverless environment, and bill the tenant. Fifth, each and every API provider has to build a custom platform to monitor and measure serverless resource usage and bill clearing functionality thus increasing the time-to-market. Sixth, there is an extreme shortage of serverless cloud developers thus making life every difficult for both API providers and SaaS app companies. Seventh, there is a scarcity of coherent and comprehensive training material for multi-tenant severless SaaS app and API developers.

Panacloud has started and is leading a social movement called Operation Unicorn to help anyone and everyone become a cloud developer, a startup founder, and participant in the API economy. The focus is on building API-First startups, which will in time become billion dollar companies. This movement is striving to build a community that will not only transform individuals, but societies and countries as well.

### Class 7: The Future of Computing

Infrastructure as code, also referred to as IaC, is an IT practice that codifies and manages underlying IT infrastructure as software. The purpose of infrastructure as code is to enable developers or operations teams to automatically manage, monitor and provision resources, rather than manually configure discrete hardware devices and operating systems. Infrastructure as code is sometimes referred to as programmable or software-defined infrastructure.

### Class 8: AWS CDK and Lambda Hello World

Create Free AWS Account

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

## We will take a 1 month Ramdan/Summer Vacation and do the following project during this vacation. The project is due after Eid. Classes will also continue after Eid.

## Project 8: Create a Token and Launch ICO/IEO/IDO


As you probably know, the ICO ("Initial Coin Offering") industry has been booming, and it's completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, go have a look at [Wikipedia's list of highest crowdfunding projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), and you'll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

[Understand the difference between IDO vs. IEO vs. ICO](https://phemex.com/blogs/what-is-a-dex-ido)

Also check these links for latest listings:

Project Part 1: How to Launch a IEO on Binance Lauchpad

[Read how to Lauch an IEO](https://appinventiv.com/blog/how-to-launch-an-ieo/)

Your first task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IEO on the [Binance Launch Pad](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/94ed108ce89d44ab8602aa3c476dfb04).

Note: Also document the alternatives to Binance Launchpad.


Project Part 2: How to Launch a IDO on Polkastarter

Review the [list of top fundraising platforms](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms)

Your second task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IDO on the [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/).


Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating an token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralised service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use openzeppelin contracts. You will use Harkhat development envirnoment. Also, write at least 20 automated tests. We will be using the Solidity and Typescript for dvelopment.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible to allow users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to
Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal "owner" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the [openzeppelin crowd sale contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales), however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write exentisive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts was uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to "register" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the "Add token" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on "Add custom token" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

[Read](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/)

Now use [Gnosis Safe]{https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

[You may follow this tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/send-token-etherjs/)


Project Part 8 Advanced: Create, Deploy, Mint, and Sell a NFT

[Read this NFT tutorial series](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)

Create a NFT contract using the [OpenZepplen ERC721 NFT Standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

You may use the [Preset ERC721 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#Presets).

Deploy your NFT contract on a testnet, mint it, and view it on the MetaMask wallet and list it on [OpenSea Marketplace](https://opensea.io/) for sale.
