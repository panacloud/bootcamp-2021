# Bootcamp 2021: Getting Developers Ready for the API Token Economy

## Fusing Serverless, Graph, AI, IoT, Blockchain, and Quantum Technologies

Covid-19 propelled businesses into the future, ready or not. “Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at Shopify Inc. “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.” We at Panacloud are trying to respond to these challenges and trying to lead from the front.

This is a Open and Free Bootcamp, for admission just [fill this admission form](https://forms.gle/QFvfSMquJZftyyiT9).

Now start following the course material.

### Bootcamp 2021 Coverage

Panacloud Bootcamp 2021 will fuse AI, IoT, Blockchain, and AWS Serverless Cloud Technologies. The Bootcamp will use Python, TypeScript and Rust as its development languages, TensorFlow as ML framework, AWS as its Serverless Cloud platform, AWS Graph Database Neptune, Ethereum as Blockchain platform and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with TypeScript for Infrastructure as Code.

### Those interested in web and mobile Serverless SaaS apps and APIs should also focus on [Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/)

Difference Between Bootcamp 2020 and Bootcamp 2021

The objective of Bootcamp 2020 is to train developers to develop cloud based SaaS Apps and general serverless APIs for these apps. It includes developing graphic user interfaces (GUIs) development using React, Gatsby, and React Native.

[Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/)

The objective of Bootcamp 2021 is to train developers to develop cloud based AI, IoT, Blockchain, and Quantum powered serverless APIs. We will not cover graphic user interfaces (GUIs) in Bootcamp 2021 but only voice based conversational interfaces. A conversational interface (CUI) is a user interface for computers that emulates a conversation with a real human. The course of this bootcamp is designed in such a way that Bootcamp 2020 is not a prerequisite to Bootcamp 2021.

[Bootcamp 2021](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2021/)

The recording of Bootcamp 2020 is now complete and in a few months recording of Bootcamp 2021 will start. When we say recording of Bootcamp 2020 is complete, it does not mean that the Bootcamp 2020 is closed. Admissions and project acceptance will remain open in both the Bootcamps at atleast till December 2023. We are also developing a platform for developers which will adopt both these bootcamps. Our upcoming Operation Unicorn Startups will also require participations in these bootcamps.

[Cloud’s trillion-dollar prize is up for grabs](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/clouds-trillion-dollar-prize-is-up-for-grabs)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

## Part 1: The API and Token Economy

### Class 1: Understanding the API Economy

The objective of Bootcamp 2021 is to prepare sofware developers for the API Economy (Application Programming Interface Economy). APIs are software interfaces that allow once separate software systems to seamlessly and easily talk to each other.  The innovative power of APIs has lead to the realization that software as a service (SaaS) applications can be built by combining APIs built by specialized API providers. That, in turn, has created the API Economy, which empowers developers to specialize and monetize their skills and domain knowledge.

A taxi booking SaaS app, for example, might combine a mapping SaaS API, communication SaaS API, and billing SaaS API, each from different providers, with their own UX layered on top. This makes it easy to launch new services without having to build everything from scratch. This makes it easier for all participants to develop unique products, services and functionality quickly and with less cost. 

In the API economy a developer may have different roles. It may be a SaaS developer or API provider. A API provider can also develop on top of other specialized APIs, thus creating layers of APIs. This creates an API economy where developers charge each other for the APIs built by them. The API provider charges others for using his APIs, and at the same time pays other providers to use their APIs. The SaaS app developers who uses all these APIs bills the end-customer for the service. This exchange of value is what makes an API economy.    

Ideally, the developer who uses SaaS APIs wants to be charged a usage based subscription fee, not a fixed monthly subscription. This usage based subscription fee has been made possible by serverless cloud technologies. Serverless is also being called Cloud 2.0.

The rise of of API Economy has created a new kind of software company i.e. an API-First Company. A company, which develops software not for the end-users as its main customer, but other developers who uses it as a component to build applications. The Panacloud platform provides the means by which developers and entrepreneurs can build their API-First Unicorn startups. 

The API Economy levels the playing field for everyone from the smallest developers to the largest companies. However, it also creates many challenges. First, often there is no direct contact between the API provider and the developer who utilizes it, it can be hard to know which API to build with what functionality. Second, it is difficult to know which APIs are available and which API to use and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. Third, most of the current SaaS applications and API are built using legacy Cloud 1.0 technologies, thus they don’t have usage based billing support and also some have scalability issues. Fourth, the APIs are centrally managed and multi-tenant by their very nature, making it difficult to manage, measure resource usage in a serverless environment, and bill the tenant. Fifth, each and every API provider has to build a custom platform to monitor and measure serverless resource usage and bill clearing functionality thus increasing the time-to-market. Sixth, there is an extreme shortage of serverless cloud developers thus making life every difficult for both API providers and SaaS app companies. Seventh, there is a scarcity of coherent and comprehensive training material for multi-tenant severless SaaS app and API developers.

Panacloud has started and is leading a social movement called Operation Unicorn to help anyone and everyone become a cloud developer, a startup founder, and participant in the API economy. The focus is on building API-First startups, which will in time become billion dollar companies. This movement is striving to build a community that will not only transform individuals, but societies and countries as well.
